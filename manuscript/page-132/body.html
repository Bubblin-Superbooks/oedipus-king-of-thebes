Mine own sons' brother;
All this, and if aught can fall
Upon man more perilous

Thou shalt not show me; therefore school me not.
Think, with what eyes hereafter in the place
Of shadows could I see my father's face,
Or my poor mother's? Both of whom this hand
Hath wronged too deep for man to understand.
Or childrenâ€”born as mine were born, to see
Their shapes should bring me joy? Great God!

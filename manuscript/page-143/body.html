<div class="leaf "><div class="inner justify"><p>Ye citizens of Thebes, behold; 'tis Oedipus that passeth here,
Who read the riddle-word of Death, and mightiest stood of mortal</p><p>men,
And Fortune loved him, and the folk that saw him turned and looked</p><p>again.
Lo, he is fallen, and around great storms and the outreaching sea!
Therefore, O Man, beware, and look toward the end of things that be,
The last of sights, the last of days; and no man's life account as gain
Ere the full tale be finished and the darkness find him without pain.</p><p>[OEDIPUS <em>is led into the house and the doors

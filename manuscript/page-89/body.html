When first he came. All they that heard him know,</p><p>![Sidenote: vv. 850-870]</p><p>Not only I. He cannot change again
Now. And if change he should, O Lord of men,
No change of his can make the prophecy
Of Laïus' death fall true. He was to die
Slain by my son. So Loxias spake.... My son!
He slew no man, that poor deserted one
That died.... And I will no more turn mine eyes
This way nor that for all their prophecies.</p><p>OEDIPUS.</p><p>Woman, thou counsellest well. Yet let it not

Nor think of aught, save thou wouldst have it so.</p><p>[JOCASTA <em>and</em> OEDIPUS <em>go together into the Palace.</em></p><p>CHORUS.</p></div> </div>

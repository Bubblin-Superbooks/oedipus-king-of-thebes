His birthright. Blind, who once had seeing eyes,
Beggared, who once had riches, in strange guise,</p><p>![Sidenote: vv. 456-478]</p><p>His staff groping before him, he shall crawl
O'er unknown earth, and voices round him call:
"Behold the brother-father of his own
Children, the seed, the sower and the sown,
Shame to his mother's blood, and to his sire
Son, murderer, incest-worker."
Cool thine ire
With thought of these, and if thou find that aught
Faileth, then hold my craft a thing of naught.</p><p>[<em>He goes out.</em> OEDIPUS <em>returns to the Palace.</em></p><p>CHORUS.</p><p>[<em>They sing of the unknown murderer,</em></p><p>What man, what man is he whom the voice of Delphi's cell
Hath named of the bloody hand, of the deed no tongue may tell?
Let him fly, fly, for his need
Hath found him; oh, where is the speed
That flew with the winds of old, the team of North-Wind's spell?</p></div> </div>

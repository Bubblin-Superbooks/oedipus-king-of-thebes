Exalted, what a tale shall ye be told,
What sights shall see, and tears of horror shed,
If still your hearts be true to them that led
Your sires! There runs no river, well I ween,
Not Phasis nor great Ister, shall wash clean
This house of all within that hidethâ€”nay,
Nor all that creepeth forth to front the day,
Of purposed horror. And in misery
That woundeth most which men have willed to be.</p><p>LEADER.</p><p>No lack there was in what we knew before
Of food for heaviness. What bring'st thou more?</p><p>MESSENGER.</p><p>One thing I bring thee first.... 'Tis quickly said.
Jocasta, our anointed queen, is dead.</p><p>![Sidenote: vv. 1236-1260]</p><p>LEADER.</p><p>Unhappy woman! How came death to her?</p></div> </div>

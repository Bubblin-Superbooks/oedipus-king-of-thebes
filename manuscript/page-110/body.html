Lest from this silence break some storm of wrong.</p><p>![Sidenote: vv. 1076-1097]</p><p>OEDIPUS.</p><p>Break what break will! My mind abideth strong
To know the roots, how low soe'er they be,
Which grew to Oedipus. This woman, she
Is proud, methinks, and fears my birth and name
Will mar her nobleness. But I, no shame
Can ever touch me. I am Fortune's child,
Not man's; her mother face hath ever smiled
Above me, and my brethren of the sky,
The changing Moons, have changed me low and high.
There is my lineage true, which none shall wrest
From me; who then am I to fear this quest?</p><p>CHORUS.</p><p>[<em>They sing</em> OEDIPUS <em>as the foundling of their

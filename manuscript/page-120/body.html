'Twas written.</p><p>OEDIPUS.</p><p>Why didst thou, then, let him go
With this old man?</p><p>SHEPHERD.</p><p>O King, I pitied him.
I thought the man would save him to some dim
And distant land, beyond all fear.... And he,
To worse than death, did save him!... Verily,
If thou art he whom this man telleth of,
To sore affliction thou art born.</p><p>OEDIPUS.</p><p>Enough!
All, all, shall be fulfilled.... Oh, on these eyes
Shed light no more, ye everlasting skies
That know my sin! I have sinned in birth and breath.
I have sinned with Woman. I have sinned with Death.</p><p>[<em>He rushes into the Palace. The</em> SHEPHERD

<div class="leaf "><div class="inner justify"><p>OEDIPUS.</p><p>O wife, why then should man fear any more
The voice of Pytho's dome, or cower before
These birds that shriek above us? They foretold
Me for my father's murderer; and behold,
He lies in Corinth dead, and here am I
And never touched the sword.... Or did he die
In grief for me who left him? In that way
I may have wrought his death.... But come what may,
He sleepeth in his grave and with him all
This deadly seercraft, of no worth at all.</p><p>JOCASTA.</p><p>Dear Lord, long since did I not show thee clear...?</p><p>OEDIPUS.</p><p>Indeed, yes. I was warped by mine own fear.</p><p>JOCASTA.</p><p>Now thou wilt cast it from thee, and forget.</p><p>OEDIPUS.</p><p>Forget my mother?... It is not over yet.</p></div> </div>

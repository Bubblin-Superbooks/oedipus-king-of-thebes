Above him, and no sight nor governance</p><p>![Sidenote: vv. 979-993]</p><p>Of things to be? To live as life may run,
No fear, no fret, were wisest 'neath the sun.
And thou, fear not thy mother. Prophets deem
A deed wrought that is wrought but in a dream.
And he to whom these things are nothing, best
Will bear his burden.</p><p>OEDIPUS.</p><p>All thou counsellest
Were good, save that my mother liveth still.
And, though thy words be wise, for good or ill
Her I still fear.</p><p>JOCASTA.</p><p>Think of thy father's tomb!
Like light across our darkness it hath come.</p><p>OEDIPUS.</p><p>Great light; but while she lives I fly from her.</p></div> </div>

That Corinth against Cadmus should do murder by the way?</p><p>No tale thereof they tell, nor no sign thereof they show;
Who dares to rise for vengeance and cast Oedipus away
For a dark, dark death long ago!</p><p>Ah, Zeus knows, and Apollo, what is dark to mortal eyes;</p><p>They are Gods. But a prophet, hath he vision more than mine?
Who hath seen? Who can answer? There be wise men and unwise.</p><p>I will wait, I will wait, for the proving of the sign.
But I list not nor hearken when they speak Oedipus ill.</p><p>We saw his face of yore, when the riddling singer passed;
And we knew him that he loved us, and we saw him great in skill.
Oh, my heart shall uphold him to the last!</p><p>![Sidenote: vv. 513-531]</p><p><em>Enter</em> CREON.</p><p>CREON.</p></div> </div>

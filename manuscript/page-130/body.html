These things upon me evilly, evilly,
Dark things and full of blood.
I knew not; I did but follow</p><p>His way; but mine the hand
And mine the anguish. What were mine eyes to me
When naught to be seen was good?</p><p>LEADER.</p><p>'Tis even so; and Truth doth speak in thee.</p><p>OEDIPUS.</p><p>To see, to endure, to hear words kindly spoken,</p><p>Should I have joy in such?
Out, if ye love your breath,
Cast me swift unto solitude, unbroken</p><p>By word or touch.
Am I not charged with death,
Most charged and filled to the brim
With curses? And what man saith
God hath so hated him?</p><p>LEADER.</p></div> </div>

Phoebus, our Lord and Seer, in clear command.
An unclean thing there is, hid in our land,
Eating the soil thereof: this ye shall cast
Out, and not foster till all help be past.</p><p>OEDIPUS.</p><p>How cast it out? What was the evil deed?</p><p>![Sidenote: vv. 100-113]</p><p>CREON.</p><p>Hunt the men out from Thebes, or make them bleed

In Thebes, ere thou didst come to pilot us.</p><p>OEDIPUS.</p></div> </div>

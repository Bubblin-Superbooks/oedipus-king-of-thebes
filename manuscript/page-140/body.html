<div class="leaf "><div class="inner justify"><p class="no-indent  ">dare wed you, whose heart rise above
The peril, to take on him all the shame
That cleaves to my name and my children's name?
God knows, it is enough!...
My flowers, ye needs must die, waste things, bereft
And fruitless.
Creon, thou alone art left
Their father now, since both of us are gone
Who cared for them. Oh, leave them not alone</p><p>![Sidenote: vv. 1505-1518]</p><p>To wander masterless, these thine own kin,
And beggared. Neither think of them such sin
As ye all know in me, but let their fate
Touch thee. So young they are, so desolateâ€”
Of all save thee. True man, give me thine hand,
And promise.</p><p>[OEDIPUS <em>and</em> CREON <em>clasp hands.</em></p><p>If your age could understand,
Children, full many counsels I could give.
But now I leave this one word: Pray to live
As life may suffer you, and find a road
To travel easier than your father trod.</p></div> </div>

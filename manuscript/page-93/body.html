<div class="leaf "><div class="inner justify"><p>Lords of the land, the ways my thought hath trod
Lead me in worship to these shrines of God
With flowers and incense flame. So dire a storm
Doth shake the King, sin, dread and every form
Of grief the world knows. 'Tis the wise man's way
To judge the morrow by the yester day;</p><p>![Sidenote: vv. 917-933]</p><p>Which he doth never, but gives eye and ear
To all who speak, will they but speak of fear.</p><p>And seeing no word of mine hath power to heal
His torment, therefore forth to thee I steal,
O Slayer of the Wolf, O Lord of Light,
Apollo: thou art near us, and of right
Dost hold us thine: to thee in prayer I fall.</p><p>[<em>She kneels at the altar of Apollo Lukeios.</em></p><p>Oh, show us still some path that is not all
Unclean; for now our captain's eyes are dim
With dread, and the whole ship must follow him.</p><p>[<em>While she prays a</em> STRANGER <em>has entered and
begins to accost the Chorus.</em></p></div> </div>

<div class="leaf "><div class="inner justify"><p>The land where the strong foot is no more strong!
Yet is there surely Pride
That saves a city; God preserve it long!
I judge not. Only through all maze of wrong
Be God, not man, my guide. [<em>Strophe.</em></p><p>[<em>Or if</em> TIRESIAS <em>can really be a lying prophet with
no fear of God; they feel that all faith in
oracles and the things of God is shaken.</em></p><p>Is there a priest who moves amid the altars
Ruthless in deed and word,
Fears not the presence of his god, nor falters
Lest Right at last be heard?
If such there be, oh, let some doom be given
Meet for his ill-starred pride,
Who will not gain his gain where Justice is,
Who will not hold his lips from blasphemies,
Who hurls rash hands amid the things of heaven
From man's touch sanctified.</p><p>In a world where such things be,
What spirit hath shield or lance</p><p>![Sidenote: vv. 893-916]</p></div> </div>

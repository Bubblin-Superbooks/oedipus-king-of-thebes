My steps to the house of Oedipus, your King?
Or, better, to himself if that may be?</p><p>LEADER.</p><p>This is the house and he within; and she
Thou seest, the mother of his royal seed.</p><p>[JOCASTA <em>rises, anxious, from her prayer.</em></p><p>STRANGER.</p><p>Being wife to such a man, happy indeed
And ringed with happy faces may she live!</p><p>JOCASTA.</p><p>To one so fair of speech may the Gods give
Like blessing, courteous stranger; 'tis thy due.
But say what leads thee hither. Can we do
Thy wish in aught, or hast thou news to bring?</p><p>![Sidenote: vv. 934-947]</p><p>STRANGER.</p></div> </div>

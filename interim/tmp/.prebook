Yet I may plead also that as a rule every\ndiligent student of these great works can add something to the\ndiscoveries of his predecessors, and I think I have been able to bring\nout a few new points in the old and much-studied <em>Oedipus</em>, chiefly\npoints connected with the dramatic technique and the religious\natmosphere."

    "innerHtml": "Mythologists tell us that Oedipus was originally a daemon haunting Mount\nKithairon, and Jocasta a form of that Earth-Mother who, as Aeschylus\nputs it, \"bringeth all things to being, and when she hath reared them\nreceiveth again their seed into her body\" (<em>Choephori</em>, 127: cf.\nCrusius, <em>Beiträge z. Gr. Myth</em>, 21). That stage of the story lies very\nfar behind the consciousness of Sophocles. But there does cling about\nboth his hero and his heroine a great deal of very primitive atmosphere.\nThere are traces in Oedipus of the pre-hellenic Medicine King, the\n<em>Basileus</em> who is also a <em>Theos</em>, and can make rain or blue sky,\npestilence or fertility. This explains many things in the Priest's first\nspeech, in the attitude of the Chorus, and in Oedipus' own language\nafter the discovery. It partly explains the hostility of Apollo, who is\nnot a mere motiveless Destroyer but a true Olympian crushing his\nEarth-born rival. And in the same way the peculiar royalty of Jocasta,\nwhich makes Oedipus at times seem not the King but the Consort of the\nQueen, brings her near to that class of consecrated queens described in\nDr. Frazer's <em>Lectures on the Kingship</em>, who are \"honoured as no woman\nnow living on the earth.\""

    "innerHtml": "The story itself, and the whole spirit in which Sophocles has treated\nit, belong not to the fifth century but to that terrible and romantic\npast from which the fifth century poets usually drew their material. The\natmosphere of brooding dread, the pollution, the curses; the \"insane and\nbeastlike cruelty,\" as an ancient Greek commentator calls it, of\npiercing the exposed child's feet in order to ensure its death and yet\navoid having actually murdered it (<em>Schol. Eur. Phoen.</em>, 26); the whole\ntreatment of the parricide and incest, not as moral offences capable of\nbeing rationally judged or even excused as unintentional, but as\nmonstrous and inhuman pollutions, the last limit of imaginable horror:\nall these things take us back to dark regions of pre-classical and even\npre-homeric belief. We have no right to suppose that Sophocles thought\nof the involuntary parricide and metrogamy as the people in his play do.\nIndeed, considering the general tone of his contemporaries and friends,\nwe may safely assume that he did not. But at any rate he has allowed no\nbreath of later enlightenment to disturb the primaeval gloom of his\natmosphere."

I know\nthat some commentators have found in it a \"humble and unquestioning\npiety,\" but I cannot help suspecting that what they saw was only a\nreflection from their own pious and unquestioning minds. Man is indeed\nshown as a \"plaything of Gods,\" but of Gods strangely and\nincomprehensibly malignant, whose ways there is no attempt to explain or\njustify.

    "innerHtml": "exposure of a child was forbidden by Theban Law. The state of feeling\nwhich produced this law, against the immensely strong conception of the\n<em>patria potestas</em>, may also have produced a folklore story telling how a\nboy once was exposed, in a peculiarly cruel way, by his wicked parents,\nand how Heaven preserved him to take upon both of them a vengeance which\nshowed that the unnatural father had no longer a father's sanctity nor\nthe unnatural mother a mother's. But, as far as Sophocles is concerned,\nif anything in the nature of a criticism of life has been admitted into\nthe play at all, it seems to be only a flash or two of that profound and\npessimistic arraignment of the ruling powers which in other plays also\nopens at times like a sudden abyss across the smooth surface of his art."

What there is, is\ndrama; drama of amazing grandeur and power. In respect of plot no Greek\nplay comes near it. It contains no doubt a few points of unsophisticated\ntechnique such as can be found in all ancient and nearly all modern\ndrama; for instance, the supposition that Oedipus has never inquired\ninto the death of his predecessor on the throne. But such flaws are\nexternal, not essential. On the whole, I can only say that the work of\ntranslation has made me feel even more strongly than before the\nextraordinary grip and reality of the dialogue, the deftness of the\nconstruction, and, except perhaps for a slight drop in the Creon scene,\nthe unbroken crescendo of tragedy from the opening to the close."

    "innerHtml": "Where plot-interest is as strong as it is in the <em>Oedipus</em>,\ncharacter-interest is apt to be comparatively weak. Yet in this play\nevery character is interesting, vital, and distinct. Oedipus himself is\nselected by Aristotle as the most effective kind of tragic hero,\nbecause, first, he has been great and glorious, and secondly he has not\nbeen \"pre-eminently virtuous or just.\" This is true in its way. Oedipus\nis too passionate to be just; but he is at least noble in his\nimpetuosity, his devotion, and his absolute truthfulness. It is\nimportant to realise that at the beginning of the play he is prepared\nfor an oracle commanding him to die for his people (pp. 6, 7). And he\nnever thinks of refusing that \"task\" any more than he tries to elude the\ndoom that actually comes, or to conceal any fact that tells against him.\nIf Oedipus had been an ordinary man the play would have been a very\ndifferent and a much poorer thing."

Euripides might have brought her character\nout more explicitly and more at length, but even he could not have made\nher more living or more tragic, or represented more subtly in her\nrelation to Oedipus both the mother's protecting love and the mother's\nauthority. As for her \"impiety,\" of which the old commentaries used to\nspeak with much disapproval, the essential fact in her life is that both\nher innocence and her happiness have, as she believes, been poisoned by\nthe craft of priests. She and Laïus both \"believed a bad oracle\": her\nterror and her love for her husband made her consent to an infamous act\nof cruelty to her own child, an act of which the thought sickens her\nstill, and about which she cannot, when she tries, speak the whole\ntruth.

I\nassumed then, what I fancy was a common assumption, that Tiresias was a\n\"sympathetic\" prophet, compact of wisdom and sanctity and all the\nqualities which beseem that calling; and I complained that he did not\nconsistently act as such. I was quite wrong. Tiresias is not anything so\ninsipid. He is a study of a real type, and a type which all the\ntragedians knew. The character of the professional seer or \"man of God\"\nhas in the imagination of most ages fluctuated between two poles. At one\nextreme are sanctity and superhuman wisdom; at the other fraud and\nmental disease, self-worship aping humility and personal malignity in\nthe guise of obedience to God. There is a touch of all these qualities,\ngood and bad alike, in Tiresias. He seems to me a most life-like as well\nas a most dramatic figure."

    "innerHtml": "As to the Chorus, it generally plays a smaller part in Sophocles than in\nEuripides and Aeschylus, and the <em>Oedipus</em> forms no exception to that\nrule. It seems to me that Sophocles was feeling his way towards a\ntechnique which would have approached that of the New Comedy or even the\nElizabethan stage, and would perhaps have done without a Chorus\naltogether. In Aeschylus Greek tragedy had been a thing of traditional\nforms and clear-cut divisions; the religious ritual showed through, and\nthe visible gods and the disguised dancers were allowed their full\nvalue. And Euripides in the matter of outward formalism went back to the\nAeschylean type and even beyond it: prologue, chorus, messenger, visible\ngod, all the traditional forms were left clear-cut and undisguised and\nall developed to full effectiveness on separate and specific lines. But\nSophocles worked by blurring his structural outlines just as he blurs\nthe ends of his verses. In him the traditional divisions are all made\nless distinct, all worked over in the direction of greater naturalness,\nat any rate in externals. This was a very great gain, but of course some\nprice had to be paid for it. Part of the price was that Sophocles could\nnever attempt the tremendous choric effects which Euripides achieves in\nsuch plays as the <em>Bacchae</em> and the <em>Trojan Women</em>. His lyrics, great as\nthey sometimes are, move their wings less boldly. They seem somehow tied\nto their particular place in the tragedy, and they have not quite the\nstrength to lift the whole drama bodily aloft with them.... At least\nthat is my feeling. But I realise that this may be only the complaint of\nan unskilful translator, blaming his material for his own defects of\nvision."

    "innerHtml": "In general, both in lyrics and in dialogue, I believe I have allowed\nmyself rather less freedom than in translating Euripides. This is partly\nbecause the writing of Euripides, being less business-like and more\npenetrated by philosophic reflections and by subtleties of technique,\nactually needs more thorough re-casting to express it at all adequately;\npartly because there is in Sophocles, amid all his passion and all his\nnaturalness, a certain severe and classic reticence, which, though\nimpossible really to reproduce by any method, is less misrepresented by\noccasional insufficiency than by habitual redundance."
